    <p>
      In my free time, I love to learn and experiment with new technologies and
      paradigms. I believe software engineering is a constant battle of design
      decisions with trade-offs at every step of the process. I strive to equip
      myself with the tools and knowledge that help make these decisions more
      informed. Sometimes the shiny new thing can be dangerous when working with
      a small team but there may lessons to learn from it.

      public catalogue that I hope others may find useful.
